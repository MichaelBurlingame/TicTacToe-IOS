<p> This App Was Created With The Goal Of Making My First "Complete" App. Complete Meaning A Stable App That Is Uploaded To The App Store.</p>

<p>For The Basic Tic Tac Toe Game Mechanics, I Did Follow A Great Tutuorial On YouTube By Sean Allen. That Being Said, The Video Only Covered The Singleplayer Gamemode Along With The Variation Of Difficulties So It Gave Me A Great Chance To Expand On The App.</p>

<p> Using NavigationViews, I Created A Main Menu Aswell As Making The Multiplayer Gamemode. The Multiplayer Mode Is Where I Was Really Able To Learn How The Game Works By Going Through And Understanding The Singleplayer Mode In Order To Replace The Computer Opponent With An Input From Another Player On The Same Screen.</p>

<p> This App Also Gave Me An Oppurtunity To Upload It To The App Store. This Process Was Fairly Easy And After An Initial Rejection Due To Not Having IPad Compatibility, It Was Available For Download.</p>
